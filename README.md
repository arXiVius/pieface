## ✨ Features (a.k.a. Homework Magic)
- 📝 **One-Time Sign-Up** → Upload your face + pick a username/password.  
- 📹 **Live Webcam Feed** → See your own face in a box (because OpenCV says so).  
- ✅ **Presence Check** → Click a button → system pretends to be your teacher → logs you in.  
- 🌍 **GPS Logging** → Because why not save your lat/long with each check?  
- 💾 **SQLite Powered** → Tiny database = big brain.  
- 🔒 **Security-ish** → Passwords hashed (no plain text, promise).
